# Showcases

## June 6, 2023

## BabyAGI
[Github](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)

> This Python script is an example of an AI-powered task management system. The system uses OpenAI and vector databases such as Chroma or Weaviate to create, prioritize, and execute tasks. The main idea behind this system is that it creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective. The script then uses OpenAI's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective, and Chroma/Weaviate to store and retrieve task results for context. This is a pared-down version of the original Task-Driven Autonomous Agent (Mar 28, 2023).

## GPTCache
[Github](https://github.com/zilliztech/gptcache)

> ChatGPT and various large language models (LLMs) boast incredible versatility, enabling the development of a wide range of applications. However, as your application grows in popularity and encounters higher traffic levels, the expenses related to LLM API calls can become substantial. Additionally, LLM services might exhibit slow response times, especially when dealing with a significant number of requests.To tackle this challenge, we have created GPTCache, a project dedicated to building a semantic cache for storing LLM responses.

## Babyagi-asi
[Github](https://github.com/oliveirabruno01/babyagi-asi)

The 🤗 Open LLM Leaderboard aims to track, rank and evaluate LLMs and chatbots as they are released. 🤗 A key advantage of this leaderboard is that anyone from the community can submit a model for automated evaluation on the 🤗 GPU cluster, as long as it is a 🤗 Transformers model with weights on the Hub. Evaluation of models with delta-weights for non-commercial licensed models are also supported, such as LLaMa.
